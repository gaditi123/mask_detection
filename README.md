# mask_detection
 In order to protect ourselves from the COVID-19 Pandemic, almost every one of us tend to wear a face mask. The development of an AI solution to detect if the person is wearing a face mask and allow their entry would be of great help to the society.
 
## About project
This project uses a Deep Neural Network, more specifically a Convolutional Neural Network, to differentiate between images of people with and without masks. 4 different types of neural network architecture were implemented - CNN, RESNet, MobileNetV2 and different filter values.
